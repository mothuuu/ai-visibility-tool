_Xeo Marketing and its 18-year-old technical co-founder launch AI Visibility Score as traditional SEO fails to capture buyers who research in AI, not Google._

TORONTO, ON, CANADA, November 24, 2025 / [EINPresswire.com](https://www.einpresswire.com/) / -- [Xeo Marketing](https://xeo.marketing/), a Toronto-based digital strategy agency, has launched the AI Visibility Score in partnership with an 18-year-old technical co-founder who represents the AI-native generation. The platform addresses a critical blind spot: businesses have no idea whether they’re visible when prospects ask ChatGPT, Claude, or Google Gemini for recommendations.

When Clients Started Asking Questions No One Could Answer

In a single week, three clients called Xeo Marketing with identical concerns: “Our SEO traffic is down 30%. Prospects mention finding competitors through ChatGPT. What do we do?”

Monali S, Founder & CEO of Xeo Marketing, had the experience to diagnose the problem—high-intent B2B buyers were shifting from Google to AI assistants—but traditional SEO tools offered no solutions.

“I knew what was happening, but needed to understand how people who’ve never known search without AI actually behave,” says Monali. “That required partnering with someone who represents that generation.”

“I’ve Never Googled the Way You Do”

“For me, there’s no ‘AI search’ versus ‘regular search'—there’s just search,” says the 18-year-old technical co-founder, Arhan Supramanyam, a Woodlands School graduate and computer science student. “I don’t type a question into Google and scroll through 10 blue links. When I need something, I ask Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT, or Claude. I get one answer. That’s it.”

He continued: “If your business isn’t structured for AI to understand and recommend you, you literally don’t exist in my world. And I’m not unique—my entire generation searches this way.”

The Problem Is Bigger Than Traffic Decline

A seismic shift is underway: AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini have become the new gatekeepers. Unlike Google search, which delivers 10 links, AI provides 1-3 specific recommendations based on deep contextual understanding.

“Our clients’ best prospects—the high-intent buyers who are actually ready to purchase—are researching in ChatGPT and Claude, not Google,” explains Monali. “Unlike keyword-based search that sends high volumes of low-quality traffic, AI search understands buyer intent, budget constraints, and specific use cases. It pre-qualifies leads before recommending businesses.”

Built for How People Actually Search Today

Rather than adapting old SEO frameworks, Xeo built from scratch for how people actually search today. The AI Visibility Score evaluates 47 factors across 8 weighted categories to reveal exactly how AI assistants understand a business—and provides implementation-ready code to optimize.

What Makes It Different?

The Analytics Gap: Traditional SEO tools measure Google rankings. AI Visibility Score reveals how ChatGPT explains your business—and whether AI is even aware you exist.

The Competitive Blind Spot: Businesses lose deals to competitors they’ve never heard of because AI recommends them instead. See exactly who AI is recommending when prospects ask about your category.

The Implementation Barrier: Most [AI optimization](https://www.visible2ai.com/) advice is generic. The platform provides implementation-ready code, industry-specific FAQ libraries, and Schema.org markup generators—no developer required.

The Quality Revolution: Unlike Google search that sends high-volume/low-quality traffic, AI search pre-qualifies leads by understanding buyer intent before making recommendations.

Who Needs This Now

Marketing agencies facing client retention challenges when asked, “Why is our SEO traffic declining, and what’s our AI strategy?” B2B service businesses losing high-intent buyers to competitors they’ve never heard of. Target industries include MSPs, telecommunications, professional services, B2B SaaS, and any business where lead quality matters more than volume.

Measurable Results

Early adopters report:

• 3.2x increase in AI-generated recommendations
• 42% improvement in qualified lead volume
• 67% higher lead-to-customer conversion rates
• 60-second assessment from URL to actionable recommendations

“We were spending heavily on Google Ads, getting unqualified leads. After optimizing our AI visibility, everything changed. Prospects started coming in pre-qualified, already familiar with our services. One told us, ‘ChatGPT recommended Vozmia when I asked about UCaaS providers.’ That had never happened before.” — Dano Ybarra, Founder, Vozmia

Funding & Growth

The AI Visibility Score has secured pre-seed funding from a private Canadian investment group to accelerate product development and market expansion. The company is building AOME (AI Orchestrated Marketing Engine), the world’s first marketing automation platform designed specifically for the AI economy.
