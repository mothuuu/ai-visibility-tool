  "mission": "## Our Mission\n\nVisible2AI helps businesses become discoverable, understandable, and recommendable by AI assistants — so your ideal customers find you first and choose you over competitors.\n\nIn a world where buyers discover brands through ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini, we give companies a clear, actionable path to becoming the answer AI recommends.\n\n**If AI doesn't understand your business, it can't recommend you. And if AI doesn't recommend you, your customers choose your competitors.**\n\n## The Shift Is Here\n\nThe way buyers find businesses has fundamentally changed.\n\n**68% of B2B buyers** now use AI assistants for research instead of Google. When they ask \"Who's the best [service] in [location]?\" — AI gives one answer, not ten links.\n\nBut here's the problem: most websites are invisible to AI.\n\nNot because they're bad — but because AI can't interpret their content, verify their credibility, or extract clear answers. Traditional SEO doesn't work. AI uses completely different signals.\n\n**There's no page two of ChatGPT. You're either the answer, or you're forgotten.**\n\n## What We Do\n\n[**AI Visibility Score**](https://www.visible2ai.com/index.html) is the first tool that measures how AI assistants see, understand, and recommend your business.\n\nIn 60 seconds, you get:\n\n- **Your AI Visibility Score** (0-1000) — how AI sees you right now\n- **8-Pillar Analysis** — breakdown across 47 factors that determine AI visibility\n- **Prioritized Recommendations** — what to fix first for maximum impact\n- **Implementation-Ready Code** — copy-paste fixes, no developer required\n\nWe don't just identify problems. We solve them.\n\n## Who We Serve\n\nVisible2AI serves any business that depends on being discovered, trusted, and recommended by AI assistants — with a strong focus on B2B companies where clarity, authority, and precision matter most.\n\n### Small & Medium Businesses\n\nProfessional services, consultants, local service businesses, coaches, trainers, educators, wellness providers, and clinics.\n\n### B2B Companies\n\nAI & tech startups, B2B SaaS, IT providers & MSPs, cybersecurity firms, telecom providers, consulting firms, marketing agencies, data & analytics companies, cloud & DevOps services, fintech, healthcare tech, legal & accounting firms, real estate & PropTech, and manufacturing & IoT providers.\n\n### Agencies & Partners\n\nMarketing agencies, SEO firms, and web developers use Visible2AI to audit client visibility and deliver measurable results.\n\n## Our Story\n\nIt started with a pattern we couldn't ignore.\n\nIn a single week, three different clients called with the same panic: \"Our SEO traffic is down 30%, our leads are garbage, and prospects keep mentioning they found competitors through ChatGPT. What do we do?\"\n\nWe knew _what_ was happening — high-intent B2B buyers were shifting from Google to AI assistants for research. But traditional SEO tools offered no solutions. Every framework, every methodology was built for a world where people clicked through search results, not one where AI delivered single answers.\n\nWe needed to understand how people who've _never known search without AI_ actually behave.\n\nThat's when our technical co-founder stepped forward with a different perspective — and a solution.\n\n## Built by Someone Who's Never Known Search Without AI\n\n**Arhan Supramanyam**, our 18-year-old technical co-founder and computer science student, represents a generation with fundamentally different search behavior.\n\n> \"When everyone kept talking about 'AI search,' I was confused. For me, there's no 'AI search' versus 'regular search' — there's just search. I've never typed a question into Google and scrolled through 10 blue links. When I need to find a restaurant, research a product, or discover a service provider, I ask ChatGPT, Claude, or Siri. I get one answer, maybe two or three options. That's it.And here's what matters: I'm not an early adopter or a tech enthusiast. This is just normal for everyone I know. My friends, my classmates — we all search this way. If your business isn't structured for AI to understand and recommend you, you literally don't exist in my world.We're not the future. We're your customers right now.\"\n\nRather than retrofitting old SEO frameworks for a new reality, Arhan built Visible2AI from first principles — designed for how people actually search today, not how they searched in 2019.",
