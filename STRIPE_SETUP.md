### 5.4 Test in Your Application

2. Your user's plan should be upgraded in the database
3. Check your Render logs for successful webhook processing:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Subscription created for user [userId]
   ‚úÖ User upgraded to [plan] plan
   ```

## Step 6: Go Live (When Ready)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Only do this when you're ready to accept real payments!

### 6.1 Switch to Live Mode in Stripe

   - Get live webhook secret

### 6.2 Update Render Environment Variables

Replace the test keys with live keys in Render:
- Update `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` with live secret key
- Update `STRIPE_PRICE_DIY` with live DIY price ID
- Update `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO` with live Pro price ID
- Update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with live webhook secret

### 6.3 Activate Your Stripe Account

1. Complete Stripe's account verification
2. Add your bank account for payouts
3. Review and accept Stripe's terms

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Webhook not receiving events

**Solution**:
1. Check that webhook URL is correct: `https://ai-visibility-tool.onrender.com/api/subscription/webhook`
2. Check Render logs for incoming webhook requests
3. Verify webhook secret matches in Render environment variables
4. Test webhook manually using Stripe CLI:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to https://ai-visibility-tool.onrender.com/api/subscription/webhook
   ```

### Issue: Checkout session not creating

**Solutions**:
1. Check Render logs for errors
2. Verify `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set correctly
3. Verify `STRIPE_PRICE_DIY` and `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO` match your Stripe products
4. Check browser console for frontend errors

### Issue: Payment succeeds but user not upgraded

**Solutions**:
1. Check webhook is receiving events (Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks)
2. Check Render logs for webhook processing errors
3. Verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches
4. Check database for user plan updates

### Issue: "No such price" error

**Solution**:
- The price ID is incorrect or doesn't exist
- Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Products and copy the correct Price ID
- Make sure you're using test price IDs in test mode and live price IDs in live mode

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Cards

Stripe provides various test cards:

| Scenario | Card Number | Result |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Success | `4242 4242 4242 4242` | Payment succeeds |
| Decline | `4000 0000 0000 0002` | Card declined |
| Insufficient funds | `4000 0000 0000 9995` | Insufficient funds |
| Expired card | `4000 0000 0000 0069` | Expired card |

Use expiry: `12/34`, CVC: `123`, ZIP: `12345` for all test cards.

## Security Best Practices

1. ‚úÖ Never commit API keys to GitHub
2. ‚úÖ Always use test mode for development
3. ‚úÖ Use environment variables for all secrets
4. ‚úÖ Verify webhook signatures (already implemented)
5. ‚úÖ Use HTTPS for all webhook endpoints (Render provides this)
6. ‚úÖ Log all payment events for audit trail
