Cable and fiber customers can typically upgrade instantly through remote provisioning without technician visits. DSL customers may require technology migration where available. Upgrade process includes checking available speeds, reviewing pricing, remote provisioning for same-technology upgrades, or scheduling installation for technology changes. Most speed increases activate immediately after processing. Fiber customers can scale from 100 Mbps to multi-gigabit on the same connection. Existing customers receive promotional upgrade pricing, retention discounts, and often waived installation fees. Self-service ordering available through customer portal."
